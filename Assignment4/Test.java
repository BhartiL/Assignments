	 * Problem-4
	 * Design a simple registration system that allows Student to register in a
	 * course using 2 classes: class Student & class Course. Implement the scenarios
	 * in class Testâ€™s main method. Each student has a name and an id variables.
	 * Each object of class Student is initialized using values of name and id
	 * passed to constructor. Class Student has accessor methods for its instance
	 * variables Each Course has a name, and a variable numberOfStudent representing
	 * the number of registered students. A course can have a maximum number of 10
	 * students registered in it. Class Course store the registered students in
	 * students which is an array of type Student. When a student register in a
	 * course, he is added to the array. Each object of class Course is initialized
	 * using the title. Class Course has the following methods: method
	 * getStudents(): return the array of registered students; method boolean
	 * isFull(): return true if the course is full, accessor method for the title
	 * and numberOfStudent field, method registerStudent (Student student): if the
	 * course is not full, register a student in course. (Score 2)
	 *
